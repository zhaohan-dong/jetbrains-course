  <p>In the code below, you are given a function <code class="java">submit_data()</code> that takes data, a client socket, and a connection address.</p> 
  <p>Finish the code by connecting the socket to this address and sending&nbsp;the data to the server. The data has the <code class="java">str</code> type, so you may need to convert it to <code class="java">bytes</code> first.</p> 
  <p>You don't have to receive any&nbsp;response from the server, however, it might be a good idea to end the connection, when you're done.</p> 
  <p>Just implement the function, no other actions are required.</p>
