  <p>Joe defined&nbsp;a dictionary listing his favorite artists, their albums, and the song from each of the albums. It looks as follows:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">tracks = {"Woodkid": {"The Golden Age": "Run Boy Run",
                      "On the Other Side": "Samara"},
          "Cure": {"Disintegration": "Lovesong",
                   "Wish": "Friday I'm in love",
                   "Seventeen Seconds": "A Forest"}}</code></pre> 
  <p>&nbsp;Joe's&nbsp;tastes can change, though.</p> 
  <p>Your task is to define a <code class="language-python">tracklist()</code> function that would take several keyword arguments representing musicians and dictionaries with albums and songs as values. For the example above, the call of this function will look as follows:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">tracklist(Woodkid={"The Golden Age": "Run Boy Run",
                   "On the Other Side": "Samara"},
          Cure={"Disintegration": "Lovesong",
                "Wish": "Friday I'm in love",
                "Seventeen Seconds": "A Forest"})</code></pre> 
  <p>The function should print the values from the dictionary in the following form:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Woodkid
ALBUM: The Golden Age TRACK: Run Boy Run
ALBUM: On the Other Side TRACK: Samara
Cure
ALBUM: Disintegration TRACK: Lovesong
ALBUM: Wish TRACK: Friday I'm in love
ALBUM: Seventeen Seconds TRACK: A Forest</code></pre> 
  <p>Avoid extra spaces. You do not need to call a function, just implement it.</p>
