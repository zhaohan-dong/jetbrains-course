  <p>Now the client for your application is a user who wants to know what rating&nbsp;a particular film has. You only have several ratings, all of which&nbsp;are stored in the&nbsp;<code class="java">CINEMA_RATINGS</code> dictionary. You should implement a handler for the GET requests.</p> 
  <p>If a film has a rating, you should return a <code class="java">HttpResponse</code> with only a rating in it.</p> 
  <p>If there is no such film in your rating database, raise <code class="java">Http404</code> Exception.</p>
